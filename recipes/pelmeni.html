    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pelmeni are traditional Russian meat-filled dumplings. Making pelmeni is favorite family pastime in the long winter
    months. These dumplings are a common convenience food - big batches can be frozen and quickly boiled or fried on demand.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Dough: </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>3/4 Cup Warm Water</li>
        <li>3 Cups All Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon All Purpose Flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>18 Ounces Ground Beef</li>
        <li>1 Small Onion, Chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Tablespoons Ice Cold Water </li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Coarse Salt</li>
        <li>Freshly Ground Pepper to Taste</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Step One
            <p>Combine egg, vegetable oil, and salt in a measuring cup; add enough water to fill to 1 cup. Pour into a bowl, add 3 cups
            flour, and knead into a smooth, elastic dough. Cover with a kitchen towel and rest for 30 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step Two
            <p>Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step Three
            <p>Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix filling thoroughly by hand or using a fork.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step Four
            <p>Roll out a portion of the dough very thinly on a lightly floured surface and cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie
            cutter or a wine glass. Keep the rest of the dough covered with a towel to avoid drying out. Place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of
            filling on one side of the dough circle. Fold dough over and seal the edges using fingers, forming a crescent. Join the
            ends and pinch them together. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Freeze
            pelmeni for 30 minutes to prevent them from sticking together.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step Five
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer and drop small batches of frozen pelmeni into simmering water.
            Cook and stir until the meat is cooked and pelmeni float to the top, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking for an additional
            5 minutes. Transfer to serving plates using a slotted spoon.</p>
