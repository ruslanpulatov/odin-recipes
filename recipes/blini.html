    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Blini (блины) are a traditional Russian crape recipe which can be enjoyed sweet or savory. They are large pancakes with a slightly thicher texture than crapes. You can serve them sweet with jam, sour cream, or honey but can also be enjoyed with salmon, ground beef and vegetables.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 1/4 Cups Milk</li>
        <li>5 Eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 Teaspoon Aalt</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons White Sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 Tablespoon Baking Soda</li>
        <li>1/8 Teaspoon Citric Acid Powder</li>
        <li>4 Cups All Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>1 Cup Boiling Water</li>
        <li>2/3 Cup Butter, Divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Step One
            <p>Beat together the milk and the eggs. Stir in the salt and the sugar and mix well. Add the baking soda and citric acid.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Step Two
            <p>Blend in the flour. Add the vegetable oil and pour in the boiling water, stirring constantly. The batter should be very
            thin, almost watery. Set the bowl aside and let it rest for 20 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step Three
            <p>Melt a tablespoon of butter in a small frying pan over medium-high heat. Pick the pan up off the heat. Pour in a
            ladleful of batter while you rotate your wrist, tilting the pan so the batter makes a circle and coats the bottom. The
            blini should be very thin.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Step Four 
            <p>Return the pan to the heat. Cook the blini for 90 seconds. Carefully lift up an edge of the blini to see if it's fully
            cooked: the edges will be golden and it should have brown spots on the surface. Flip the blini over and cook the other
            side for 1 minute.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Step Five
            <p>
                Transfer the blini to a plate lined with a clean kitchen towel. Continue cooking the blini, adding an additional
                tablespoon of butter to the pan after each 4 blini. Stack them on top of each other and cover with the kitchen towel to
                keep warm.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Step Six
            <p>Spread your favorite filling in the center of the blini, and fold three times to make a triangle shape. You can also
            fold up all 4 sides, like a small burrito.</p>
